# ToadUI - Demos

This folder contains example UIs built using ToadUI. Many of the scripts have additional flags that can be viewed by adding `-h` or `--help` when running the scripts.

## game_of_life.py

This demo runs an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

https://github.com/heyoeyo/toadui/blob/b3ff4c0babbba2aa864d824ae38e3bf05924eae7/demos/game_of_life_example.mp4

There's a built-in heatmap feature, implemented using colormapping, which colors cells based on the length of time passed since the cell has been active. This helps to visualize the 'trail' of the patterns/structures generated by the simulation. There's also support for manually placing pre-defined patterns or using random arrangements. Through script arguments, it's also possible to provide a custom colormap and/or a cell pattern.

**UI Elements:** ColormapsBar, TextCarousel, ImmediateButton, ToggleButton, Slider

## image_cropping.py

This demo runs a simple UI for cropping images or frames from videos.

The UI includes support for interactive click-and-drag boxes. The built-in [selectROI](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html#ga99cbbe0e7ed2e099e52c367ea4306be4) from Opencv, provides similar functionality, but locks up the display while doing so. The ToadUI implementation allows for continuous rendering/UI updates as well as interactively modifiying the box after-the-fact.

**UI Elements:** FixedARImage, ZoomImage, Swapper, ToggleImageButton, EditBoxOverlay, DrawRectangleOverlay, VideoPlaybackSlider, PrefixedTextBlock

## video_playback.py

This demo runs a simple video player UI.

Unlike the [simple example](https://github.com/heyoeyo/toadui?tab=readme-ov-file#simple-example) found on the main README, this demo draws a circle that follows the mouse when hovering the video image. It also includes basic read-outs for the mouse positioning and support for stepping the video forwards/backwards using the arrow keys.

**UI Elements:** VideoPlaybackSlider, PrefixedTextBlock


## video_warping.py

This demo allows the user to warp image or video data, interactively.

https://github.com/heyoeyo/toadui/blob/b3ff4c0babbba2aa864d824ae38e3bf05924eae7/demos/video_warp_example.mp4

This demo supports the use of input images or videos, including webcams! Warping is done using [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) and the [OpenCV remap function](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d1/da0/tutorial_remap.html) and can produce some funny, often bizarre imagery. If an input source isn't provided, a [truchet pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles) will be used.

**UI Elements:** VideoPlaybackSlider, TextCarousel, ImmediateButton, ToggleButton, Slider, StaticMessageBar
