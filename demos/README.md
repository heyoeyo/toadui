# ToadUI - Demos

This folder contains examples built using ToadUI. Many of the scripts have additional flags that can be viewed by adding `-h` or `--help` when running the scripts.

These demos are written so that the main functionality fits within ~100 lines of code. They're meant to be simple to follow and/or modify.  The main logic is usually found at the end of the script, under a `with window.auto_close` block, so start there if you'd like to make changes.

## game_of_life.py

This demo runs an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), while maintaining a heatmap.

</p>

When active, the heatmap is visualized through colormapping, where cells are colored based on the length of time passed since the cell has been active. This helps to visualize the 'trail' of the patterns/structures generated by the simulation. It's also possible to directly click to modify cell states, as well as initializing using random patterns. Through script arguments, custom colormaps and/or a cell patterns can be provided.

**UI Elements:** ColormapsBar, TextCarousel, ImmediateButton, ToggleButton, Slider

## image_cropping.py

This demo runs a simple UI for cropping images or frames from videos.

The UI includes support for interactive click-and-drag boxes. The built-in [selectROI](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html#ga99cbbe0e7ed2e099e52c367ea4306be4) from OpenCV provides similar functionality, but locks up the display while doing so. The ToadUI implementation allows for continuous rendering/UI updates as well as interactively modifiying the box after-the-fact.

**UI Elements:** FixedARImage, ZoomImage, Swapper, ToggleImageButton, EditBoxOverlay, DrawRectangleOverlay, VideoPlaybackSlider, PrefixedTextBlock


## ocv_optical_flow.py

This demo provides an interactive visualization of the dense [optical flow](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html) implementation built into OpenCV (i.e. the [calcOpticalFlowFarneback(...)](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/dc/d6b/group__video__track.html#ga5d10ebbd59fe09c5f650289ec0ece5af) function). The input video is shown side-by-side with a false-color optical flow result (colors indicate direction of movement, for example, green is downward), along with the delta-x & delta-y flow components.

</p>

The UI provides a one-to-one mapping of the OpenCV function arguments (obscure things like: `pyr_scale`, `levels`, `winsize` etc.), allowing the user to modify these in real-time while observing the optical flow results. This demo is a particularly good use case of ToadUI, providing a way to visualize a complex image processing routine, while also being interactive.

**UI Elements:** ToggleButton, Slider, PrefixedTextBlock, HoverLabelOverlay

## video_playback.py

This demo runs a simple video player UI. It's a good starter template for UIs involving video (or webcam) inputs.

</p>

Unlike the [simple example](https://github.com/heyoeyo/toadui?tab=readme-ov-file#simple-example) found on the main README, this demo draws a circle that follows the mouse when hovering the video image. It also includes basic read-outs for the mouse positioning and support for stepping the video forwards/backwards using the arrow keys.

**UI Elements:** VideoPlaybackSlider, PrefixedTextBlock


## video_warping.py

This demo allows the user to warp image or video data, interactively.

</p>

This demo supports the use of input images or videos, including webcams! Warping is done using [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) and the [OpenCV remap function](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d1/da0/tutorial_remap.html) and can produce some funny, often bizarre imagery, especially when using rainbow coloring. If an input source isn't provided, a [truchet pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles) will be used.

**UI Elements:** VideoPlaybackSlider, TextCarousel, ImmediateButton, ToggleButton, Slider, StaticMessageBar
